### About the academia
I amb a computer Enginyer graduated on 2011 in the Politechnic University of Barcelona. In addition on 2014 I finished the Free Software Master imparted on the UOC university (Open University of Catalonia).

After studying in the University for about 9 years, I must say it is not worth at all. The best way to learn and understand how the computers work is by hacking them. Just open the machine and try to fix it once it stops working (or even before!). Just use the World Wide Web to read and learn about the topics you are interested on. Just participate in some free sofware projects to get knowladge from others.

Be a self-taught person my friend, on one but you can understand things for you.

### About my jobs 
I started working at the 19 years old (while studying) on a software company. As I love the free software movement and GNU/Linux as its main representation, I quickly became a junior systems administrator performing the senior's work. 

Until the age of 25 I worked in several private companies, all of them related with GNU/Linux.

At the age of 25 (when I finished my degree) I jumped into the University research world. In addition to the free software I also love the free networks movement. So I got very involved in the Guifi.net project. Thanks to this fact I was able to participate in several research funded by the European Comission.

Right now, from 2015/02, I'm officialy unemployed but looking for new (paid) projects to devote my time in the future.

Meanwhile there is nothing new interesting, I'm still working in my own things and participating in many projects.

### My projects
I am a BitCoin and crypto-currency lover. I really think it can be something important in the near future.
